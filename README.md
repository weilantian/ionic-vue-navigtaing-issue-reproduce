A experiment repo that reproduce the navigation animation issue in Ionic Vue while using iOS theme.

Here is the repo I created by using the command

```
ionic start navigatingIssue tabs
```

And I created two blanks pages with `<ion-page>`tag, and I have configured the router to point one page to `/page1`, another to `/page2`

After that, I created a button which uses `@click` to triggers the `router.push()`
